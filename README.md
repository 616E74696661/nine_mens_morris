## game rules / phases

- 2 players, 9 pieces per player
- pieces are placed and moved on the line crossing of the board
- whenever three pieces of the same player are places in a straight row, a mill is closed and one opponent piece has to be removced
- the goal of the game is to reduce the opponent to only two pieces or to surround the opponent pieces in such a way that there are no valid moves for the opponent

### opening

- each player places one piece on an unoccupied position on the board in turns
- if a mill is closed by setting a piece, the player may take one of the opponent's pieces

### midgame

- once all pieces are set, the midgame starts
- each player moves one piece along the lines to a free, neighboring position
- if a mill is closed by moving a piece, the player may take one of the opponent's pieces
- a player must move a piece in EACH turn
- if there is no legal move, the player has lost

### endgame

- if a player has only three pieces left, they can jump with one piece to any unoccupied position instead of moving only along the board lines
